    abstract = {{Being able to combine static and dynamic typing within the same language has clear benefits in order to support the evolution of prototypes or scripts into mature robust programs. While being an emblematic dynamic object-oriented language, Smalltalk is lagging behind in this regard. We report on the design, implementation and application of Gradualtalk, a gradually-typed Smalltalk meant to enable incremental typing of existing programs. The main design goal of the type system is to support the features of the Smalltalk language, like metaclasses and blocks, live programming, and to accomodate the programming idioms used in practice. We studied a number of existing projects in order to determine the features to include in the type system. As a result, Gradualtalk is a practical approach to gradual types in Smalltalk, with a novel blend of type system features that accomodate most programming idioms.}},

@inproceedings{Gael04c,
  Abstract     = {Although unit testing is essential for programming,
                  current languages only barely support the developer
                  in composing unit tests into new ones or in
                  navigating between unit tests and their
                  corresponding methods under test. We have taken
                  several Smalltalk programs and analyzed the
                  relationships between unit tests and methods under
                  test, and the re- lationships amongst unit tests.
                  First results indicate that most unit tests can be
                  seen or at least decomposed into commands which
                  focus on single methods, and that large portions of
                  unit tests overlap each other. But these
                  relationships between unit tests and methods under
                  test are not reflected in current languages. We
                  therefore first conceptually extend the meta-model
                  of Smalltalk with one-method commands so that unit
                  tests become both com- posable and navigable. Then
                  we introduce a first lightweight implementation of
                  this meta model using method comments to
                  differentiate between the several test phases of
                  existing XUnit test case methods.},
